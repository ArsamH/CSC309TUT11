- used AI to look over my database design in schema.prisma and find potential mistakes
        - it specifically helped with learning junction tables
        ie. in a many-to-many you don't need to specify @relation("joinedName") if there is only a single reference to another entity.
            however, when you have multiple references to the same entity such as User and Transactions needing separate transactions
            and createdTransactions, then the relation must be specified. 

- used AI to help with regex for all the middleware used through out the code
        - slightly helped with the createsu.js seed script since I did not know the necessity of 'await prisma.$disconnect()'

- used AI to implement multer middleware

- used AI to learn in memory pagination 
ie.     const skip = (pageNumber - 1) * limitNumber;
        const paginatedEvents = filteredEvents.slice(skip, skip + limitNumber); (this works just as well as skip, take)

- i used AI to debug through out. I would copy the result from the MARKUS failed test case and also copy the relevant code I had written to 
derive possible conclusions. How the AI helped here is one of two ways:
        1. inferred possible fixes 
        2. gave me console log statements to further debug and repeat step 1
